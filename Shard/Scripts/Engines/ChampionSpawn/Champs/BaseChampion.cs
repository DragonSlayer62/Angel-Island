/* Scripts\Engines\ChampionSpawn\Champs\BaseChampion.cs
 * ChangeLog:
 *	3/15/08, Adam
 *		Move DistributedLoot() to Scripts/Misc/ChampLoot.cs to be used as a shared facility.
 *			i.e., new ChampLootPack(this).DistributedLoot()
 *  3/19/07, Adam
 *      Pacakge up loot generation and move it into BaseCreature.cs
 *      We want to be able to designate any creature as a champ via our Mobile Factory
 *  03/09/07, plasma    
 *      Removed cannedevil namespace reference
 *  1/11/07, Adam
 *      Check the the skull type is not None before dropping it.
 *  01/05/07, plasma
 *      Changed CannedEvil namespace to ChampionSpawn for cleanup!
 *  8/16/05, Rhiannon
 *		Added constructors to allow champions to have individual min and max speeds.
 *	12/6/05, Adam
 *		Cleanup:
 *			1. get rid of funky OnDeath() override
 *			2. Check OnDeath() for creature: (this is AdamsCat || this is CraZyLucY)
 *				don't drop skull
 *	12/23/04, Adam
 *		Remove the check to see if we're in felucca before dropping champ skull.
 *		Search string: c.DropItem( new ChampionSkull( SkullType ) );
 *	12/15/04, Adam
 *		While we're in Shame III, we want to hard code the gold drop location - OnBeforeDeath()
 *			to return to normal operation, see the comments in OnBeforeDeath()
 *	10/17/04, Adam
 *		Increase gold drop from: Gold( 400, 600 )
 *			to: Gold( 800, 1200 )
 *		Old drop was like ~10K, now it will be ~30K
 *		(25 piles * 1200 = 30K gold)
 *	7/1/04, Adam
 *		Adam's Cat uses base champ code, but doesn't want the ChampionSkull drop
 * 		Add new OnDeath() method that skips the skull drop
 *  6/5/04, Pix
 *		Merged in 1.0RC0 code.
 *	4/29/04, mith
 *		Removed Justice rewards now that virtues are disabled.
 *		Modified the amount of items given. Modified weapon rewards to also reward with armor.
 *	3/23/04 code changes by mith:
 *		OnBeforeDeath() - replaced GivePowerScrolls with GiveMagicItems
 *		GiveMagicItems() - new function to award players with magic items upon death of champion
 *		CreateWeapon()/CreateArmor() - called by GiveMagicItems to create random item to be awarded to player
 *	3/17/04 code changes by mith:
 *		OnBeforeDeath() - Decreased radius of gold drop
 *		GoodiesTimer.OnClick() - Decreased amount of random gold dropped
