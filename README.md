Hi, this is Adam Ant (Luke Tomasello), creator/designer of the Angel Island (Ultima Online) Player Run Shard.
I have just published the complete source code to Angel Island as of May 2017, when I shutdown the shard.

I launched Angel Island in March of 2004, and actively developed it for the next 7 years.

This distribution is complete:
The complete shard source code as well as executables
The Razor launcher
And the Angel Island 'Golden Client'. The preferred UO client to use with Angel Island.

I modified Golden Client installation to install the original (old-school MIDI filed for music.)
The Golden Client installer is digitally Signed by Tomasello Software.

NOTES ABOUT THIS DISTRIBUTION:
The distribution is complete. With it, you can simply unpack the client and Razor and run the server. I rebuilt everything today, and everything runs as expected.

The Server is built with Visual Studio 2005. If you want (and you probably do,) import to a newer version of Visual Studio, you will need to make some changes as Visual Studio changed the way .NET is referenced. It's probably minor, but something to look out for.

The Angel Island Shard contains all of the original features of Angel Island. Far too many to name, but including:
o) Slayer template
o) Summoner Template
o) Elimination of Ghost Spies
o) Sea Gypsies (quest)
o) Random treasure map locations
o) Balanced PvP
o) Custom Housing
o) Townships
o) Unique Angel Island Deco
o) Anti-macroing (CAPTCHA) system
o) Capture the Flag
o) many unique monsters
o) And Angel Island itself – a prison quest for murderers
(And much more.)

NOTES ABOUT THE SHARD:

The shard will launch without any parameters as Publish 5 I believe, but the shard supports many command line arguments:
The command line arguments include what Publish you want (supported to varying degrees.) The Angel Shard always ran the Publish 15 rule set (before Age of Shadows.)
I think Publish was the Second Age which I was working before I quit development. I made some progress on Crafting, but it’s incomplete.
Other command line switches allow you to launch the shard in Test Center mode, Event Mode, and even Mortalis Mode (where death is final.)
Spend some time learning the startup switches, but Publish numbers (besides 15,) are not guaranteed to be complete.

The shard still contains many player accounts, but all of the passwords have been reset so as to prevent an admin from reverse engineering account information.
The one account left intact was my own, Adam Ant.
The Adam Ant account is “adam ant” with password uoadam04.
I wish the share this because the Adam character (my main) had several important items in his possession. One such item (looks like a rune,) is the “Command Console”. This Command Console allows you to dynamically change certain shard characteristics in real-time.

ITEMS:

While you may be tempted to delete all the items, be forewarned. These items not only hold all of the spawners, deco, etc. for Angel Island, but also all of Angel Islands special and custom “regions”. These regions control much of what Angel Island is. For instance, the Angel Island Prison has a highly customized region for managing prisoners. 
All of these ‘region controllers’ are located on Green Acres. 

QESTIONS:

While I will respond to questions on both facebook and gethub, I won’t be answering questions on standard RunUO (angel island base code) operation, installation, ports and such. These are easily found by googling RunUO setup.
I will be answering Angel Island specific questions (to the best of my recollection.)
I will try to update the GetHub wiki as time/interest permits.

TONS OF FEATURES WITH LITTLE DOCUMENTATION:

Angel Island has hundreds of enhancements over standard RunUO. All of this was meticulously documented on game-master.net. 
game-master.net is no longer online, but I do have an archive of it. Should interest dictate, I may resurrect game-master.net for the purpose of resurrecting this documentation for you use.
For now though, consider it an adventure!

Feedback is welcome.
